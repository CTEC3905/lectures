`let regularAttendance = "better grade";`

- **attendance** and **active attention** in **labs** *and* **lectures**
- requires **self-motivation** and initiative
- satisfactory **achievement** of **lab exercises**

Specific **learning outcomes** are given for some labs

===

# BLACKBOARD

## ALL **LECTURES** and  **LABS**…

are **numbered**:

- **lectures:** links to slides online and Panopto video
- **labs:** complete lab exercises and links to starter code

**agile learning materials** mean there's a **lab and lecture plan**
but some content **emerges as the module progresses**

---

## **BLACKBOARD** AREAS

- **Announcements:** (including jobs)
- **Staff Contacts:** Graeme, Fania, Dave
- **Module Information:** and handbook
- **Lectures:** numbered, links to lecture slides and video
- **Labs:** numbered, exercise details, links to code on GitHub
- **Learning Materials:** resources as required/requested
- **Assessment:** assignment brief, marking scheme, hand-in

---

## **BLACKBOARD** LEARNING MATERIALS

The **Learning Materials** section contains:

===

# GIT **AND GITHUB**

- open a [free GitHub 3 year Education Account](https://education.github.com/)
- the module assignment requires **regular GIT commits**
- You will need to **learn GIT basics**
- if your **code goes bad** you can **rewind**

**DON’T** use other social online version control services (BitBucket, GitLab…) for this module

---

## GIT **MODULE PAGES**

[github.com/CTEC3905](https://github.com/CTEC3905)

- **lab code** & examples
- **lecture slides** (HTML and PDF)

*updated by tutors regularly (sometimes even during classes):*

- You might spot an **error** we need to fix
- there's an unforeseen **browser issue**
- lab exercise code needs **clarification**

===

# NOT COVERED

your **web developer friends might say** (every year!):

- "Just use Bootstrap/HTML boilerplate…"
- "*Everyone's* using React/Angular/etc."
- "*Everyone* uses JQuery. Why write JavaScript?"
- "To look modern it needs parallax scrolling"
- "All sites have a fat footer nowadays"
- "Use CoffeeScript/TypeScript/SASS/etc…"

People will always ask "[should I learn X **OR** Y?](https://www.quora.com/Is-React-killing-Angular)" or [A **OR** B](https://www.quora.com/What-framework-is-faster-Angular-or-React/answer/Aymeric-Tibere?srid=2K0v)…
and ignore the fact that [there's a **C**](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-alternatives-to-AngularJS-2-0-ReactJS-or-PolymerJS/answer/Dave-Everitt) or [a **Z**](https://www.quora.com/Should-I-learn-React-or-AngularJS/answer/Dave-Everitt?srid=2K0v)!

---

## WHY THESE AREN'T COVERED
<!-- .slide: class="smalltext" -->

- **Learn the core languages** to be competent
- Being a **JavaScript developer is future-proof**. Being a *specific framework* developer is *not* (no matter what companies or managers ask for)
- [Framework fashions](https://superdevresources.com/popular-javascript-frameworks/) (<-good guide!) change all the time
- Frameworks owned by [large corporations](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/facebook-just-changed-the-license-on-react-heres-a-2-minute-explanation-why-5878478913b2) have their own agenda
- We can point you to the most likely current trends
- For [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (**back-end**) your JavaScript skills will transfer
- We don't teach Bootstrap/SASS/LESS/cssnext, etc. because  
**CSS Grid Layout** with custom properties **is the framework**

===

# LEARNING **OUTCOMES**
<!-- .slide: class="crammed" -->

The **official learning outcomes** are:

1. Demonstrate detailed understanding of all **three** current **front-end web technologies**, their use and context
2. Create a fully **standards-compliant**, **responsive** and **accessible** website or web-technology-based application
3. Demonstrate critical understanding of **Information Architecture**, interface **design**, **usability** and **semantic markup**
4. Use **GIT** and GitHub for **version control** and code storage

---

## LEARNING **EXTRAS**

- some understanding of the **cultures and decisions** driving current front-end web technologies
-	how **basic design principles** affect usability and user interface (UI) design
- how **Information Architecture** aids navigability, usability and structure
- an ability to **critically evaluate** internet technologies and languages
- pointers towards **what’s happening next** for web technologies

# A BRIEF **HTML HISTORY**
<!-- .slide: class="crammed smalltext" -->

- **SGML** is the basis (`title`, `h1-6`, `p`, `ol`, `ul`...)
- **1965** Ted Nelson, hyperlink
- **1987** Hypercard uses local hyperlinks (Bill Atkinson, Apple)
- **HTML** devised by Tim Berner-Lee (TBL) when at CERN
- **1989** TBL creates HTML/www on the [Unix-based NeXT](https://collection.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/objects/co8232360/next-cube-computer-1990-personal-computer) (for **collaborative research**)
- **1989** global hypertext project - the **W**orld**W**ide**W**eb (www)
- **1991** the **Internet** first carries the **www**

# Latest version: **HTML5**

*Semantic* tags (they **do** what they **say**) e.g.
`header`, `figure`+`figcaption`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `footer`…

# HOW WEBSITES WORK: **1**
<!-- .slide: class="crammed" -->

**BACK END: ‘server’**  
  (you may be familiar with this): handles **requests for resources**, does any necessary **processing or retrieval** (say from a database) finds images and other files, and sends it all to your browser.

**FRONT END: ‘client’**  
  (the subject of this module) typically a web browser—**receives content** from the server, **renders and displays** the pages you view, creates the **HTML DOM**, applies **CSS** styles and handles **JavaScript** interactions, including communication with online data.

---

# HOW WEBSITES WORK: **2**
<!-- .slide: class="crammed" -->

HTML5 documents begins with this **document type**:

```html
<!doctype html>
```
then the **HTML** (parent) element:
```html
<html>
```
Then some **information** the browser needs:
```html
<head>
```
Then what actually **appears** in the browser:
```html
<body>
```

---

# HOW WEBSITES WORK: **3**
<!-- .slide: class="crammed" -->

**All websites** have the following **fundamental HTML tags**

```html
<!doctype html>

<html>

  <head>
  </head>

  <body>
  </body>

</html>
```

---

# HOW WEBSITES WORK: **4**
<!-- .slide: class="crammed" -->

Visible content is between **matching pairs** of HTML tags:

```html
<header>The box at the top</header>

<p>Some text in a paragraph</p>

<footer>The box at the bottom</footer>
```

---

# HOW WEBSITES WORK: **5**
<!-- .slide: class="crammed" -->

Some tags **don't need 'closing'** e.g. the `img` tag:

```html
<img src="my-images/my-duck-face.png">
```
The only other **'self-closing' tags** you might use are:

```html
<br> <!-- a line break -->

<input> <!-- for forms -->
```

---

# HOW WEBSITES WORK: **6**
<!-- .slide: class="crammed" -->

A **hyperlink** goes to **another page**, **website**.  
It can also link to a **specific section on the same page**, identified by an HTML `id` attribute:

```html
<a href="http://xkcd.com">Go to another website</a>

<a href="another-page.html">Go to another page</a>

<a href="#my-section">Jump to an ID on the same page</a>

<section id="my-section">
  <p>A paragraph inside the section</p>
</section>
```

---

# HOW WEBSITES WORK: **7**
<!-- .slide: class="crammed" -->

most HTML tags are **nested inside** other HTML tags:

```html
<header>
  <h1>The main heading</h1>
</header>

<main>
  <section>
    <h2>A section heading</h2>
    <p>Some text in a paragraph</p>
  </section>
</main>
```

---

# HOW WEBSITES WORK: **8**

You can add **HTML comments** in your code:

```html
<!-- The figure tag is for image/captions boxes -->

<figure>
  <!-- The img tag goes here -->
  <!-- The figcaption tag goes here -->
</figure>
```

Text between `<!--` and `-->` won't show on screen.

===

# SUMMARY:

- **HTML** you only need some tags, *don't* learn them all!
- **HTML** tags are *nested* inside other HTML tags
- **CSS** learn the *syntax*, use only what you need
- **indent your code** as you go, with *2 spaces*
- **JavaScript** is for *programming* interaction or data

# AN ANSWER TO:

**"[I want to be a Web Developer but I know nothing…](https://www.quora.com/I-want-to-be-a-web-developer-but-I-know-absolutely-nothing-about-it-What-should-I-learn-and-how-and-where-can-I-learn-it/answer/Dave-Everitt?srid=2K0v\)"**

> Since its inception, the web has been primarily about information but this data-driven trend can just drown people with a flood of disconnected, random info factoids that few can grasp and even fewer be interested in.
>
> **The goal of a front end developer** is to create clear, easy, fast pages and interfaces that will make people understand and care about the information, by putting it in context… and revealing implicit or explicit interconnections.
>
> Front-end is not just a pretty face, it's the friendly, **forward-looking interface of web development**.
